--   Haskell bindings for Advent of Code REST API. Please use responsibly!
--   
--   Requires libcurl.
@package advent-of-code-api
@version 0.1.0.0


-- | Haskell bindings for Advent of Code 2018 API. Caches and throttles
--   requests automatically.
--   
--   Specify your requests with <a>AoC</a> and <a>AoCOpts</a>, and run them
--   with <a>runAoC</a>.
--   
--   Example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   -- fetch prompts for day 5
--   <a>runAoC</a> myOpts $ <a>AoCPrompt</a> (<a>mkDay_</a> 5)
--   
--   -- fetch input for day 8
--   <a>runAoC</a> myOpts $ <a>AoCInput</a> (<a>mkDay_</a> 8)
--   
--   -- submit answer "hello" for day 10, part 1
--   <a>runAoC</a> myOpts $ <a>AoCSubmit</a> (<a>mkDay_</a> 10) <a>Part1</a> "hello"
--   </pre>
--   
--   Please use responsibly. All actions are rate-limited to a minimum of
--   one request per minute.
--   
--   Note that leaderboard API is not yet supported.
module Advent

-- | An API command. An <tt><a>AoC</a> a</tt> an AoC API request that
--   returns results of type <tt>a</tt>.
--   
--   A lot of these commands take <tt><a>Finite</a> 25</tt>, which
--   represents a day of December up to and including Christmas Day
--   (December 25th). You can convert an integer day (1 - 25) into a
--   <tt><a>Finite</a> 25</tt> representing that day using <a>mkDay</a> or
--   <a>mkDay_</a>.
data AoC :: Type -> Type

-- | Fetch prompts for a given day. Returns a <a>Map</a> of <a>Part</a>s
--   and their associated promps, as HTML.
[AoCPrompt] :: Finite 25 -> AoC (Map Part Text)

-- | Fetch input, as plaintext. Returned verbatim. Be aware that input
--   might contain trailing newlines.
[AoCInput] :: Finite 25 -> AoC Text

-- | Submit a plaintext answer (the <a>String</a>) to a given day and part.
--   Receive a server reponse (as HTML) and a response code
--   <tt>SumbitRes</tt>.
--   
--   <b>WARNING</b>: Answers are not length-limited. Answers are stripped
--   of leading and trailing whitespace and run through <a>encode</a>
--   before submitting.
[AoCSubmit] :: Finite 25 -> Part -> String -> AoC (Text, SubmitRes)

-- | A given part of a problem. All Advent of Code challenges are
--   two-parts.
--   
--   You can usually get <a>Part1</a> (if it is already released) with a
--   nonsense session key, but <a>Part2</a> always requires a valid session
--   key.
--   
--   Note also that Challenge #25 typically only has a single part.
data Part
Part1 :: Part
Part2 :: Part

-- | Setings for running an API request.
--   
--   Session keys are required for all commands, but if you enter a bogus
--   key you should be able to get at least Part 1 from <a>AoCPrompt</a>.
--   
--   The session key can be found by logging in on a web client and
--   checking the cookies. You can usually check these with in-browser
--   developer tools.
--   
--   Throttling is hard-limited to a minimum of 1 second between calls.
--   Please be respectful and do not try to bypass this.
--   
--   If no cache directory is given, one will be allocated using
--   <a>getTemporaryDirectory</a>.
data AoCOpts
AoCOpts :: String -> Integer -> Maybe FilePath -> Bool -> Int -> AoCOpts

-- | Session key
[_aSessionKey] :: AoCOpts -> String

-- | Year of challenge
[_aYear] :: AoCOpts -> Integer

-- | Cache directory
[_aCache] :: AoCOpts -> Maybe FilePath

-- | Fetch results even if cached. Still subject to throttling. Default is
--   False.
[_aForce] :: AoCOpts -> Bool

-- | Throttle delay, in milliseconds. Minimum is 1000000. Default is
--   3000000 (3 seconds).
[_aThrottle] :: AoCOpts -> Int

-- | The result of a submission.
data SubmitRes

-- | Correct submission, including global rank (if reported, which usually
--   happens if rank is under 1000)
SubCorrect :: Maybe Integer -> SubmitRes

-- | Incorrect submission. Check response text for hints (often, "too high"
--   or "too low"), and also for the wait time required before the next
--   submission.
SubIncorrect :: SubmitRes

-- | Submission was rejected because an incorrect submission was recently
--   submitted. Check response text for wait time.
SubWait :: SubmitRes

-- | Submission was rejected because it was sent to an invalid question or
--   part. Usually happens if you submit to a part you have already
--   answered or have not yet unlocked.
SubInvalid :: SubmitRes

-- | Could not parse server response.
SubUnknown :: SubmitRes

-- | Pretty-print a <a>SubmitRes</a>
showSubmitRes :: SubmitRes -> String

-- | Run an <a>AoC</a> command with a given <a>AoCOpts</a> to produce the
--   result or a list of (lines of) errors.
--   
--   <b>WARNING</b>: Answers are not length-limited. Answers are stripped
--   of leading and trailing whitespace and run through <a>encode</a>
--   before submitting.
runAoC :: AoCOpts -> AoC a -> IO (Either AoCError a)

-- | Sensible defaults for <a>AoCOpts</a> for a given year and session key.
--   
--   Use system temporary directory as cache, and throttle requests to one
--   request per three seconds.
defaultAoCOpts :: Integer -> String -> AoCOpts

-- | A possible (syncronous, logical, pure) error returnable from
--   <a>runAoC</a>. Does not cover any asynchronous or IO errors.
data AoCError

-- | A libcurl error, with response code and response body
AoCCurlError :: CurlCode -> String -> AoCError

-- | Tried to get interact with a challenge that has not yet been released.
--   Contains the amount of time until release.
AoCReleaseError :: NominalDiffTime -> AoCError

-- | The throttler limit is full. Either make less requests, or adjust it
--   with <a>setAoCThrottleLimit</a>.
AoCThrottleError :: AoCError

-- | Prompt release time
challengeReleaseTime :: Integer -> Finite 25 -> UTCTime

-- | Get time until release of a given challenge.
timeToRelease :: Integer -> Finite 25 -> IO NominalDiffTime

-- | Check if a challenge has been released yet.
challengeReleased :: Integer -> Finite 25 -> IO Bool

-- | Construct a <tt><a>Finite</a> 25</tt> (the type of a Day) from a day
--   integer (1 - 25). If input is out of range, <a>Nothing</a> is
--   returned. See <a>mkDay_</a> for an unsafe version useful for literals.
--   
--   Inverse of <a>dayInt</a>.
mkDay :: Integer -> Maybe (Finite 25)

-- | Construct a <tt><a>Finite</a> 25</tt> (the type of a Day) from a day
--   integer (1 - 25). Is undefined if input is out of range. Can be useful
--   for compile-time literals, like <tt><a>mkDay_</a> 4</tt>
--   
--   Inverse of <a>dayInt</a>.
mkDay_ :: Integer -> Finite 25

-- | Convert a <tt><a>Finite</a> 25</tt> day into a day integer (1 - 25).
--   Inverse of <a>mkDay</a>.
dayInt :: Finite 25 -> Integer

-- | Get the day associated with a given API command.
aocDay :: AoC a -> Finite 25

-- | A character associated with a given part. <a>Part1</a> is associated
--   with <tt>'a'</tt>, and <a>Part2</a> is associated with <tt>'b'</tt>
partChar :: Part -> Char

-- | Convert a <a>Part</a> to an <a>Int</a>.
partInt :: Part -> Int

-- | Set the internal throttler maximum queue capacity. Default is 1000.
setAoCThrottleLimit :: Int -> IO ()

-- | Get the internal throttler maximum queue capacity.
getAoCThrottleLimit :: IO Int

-- | Parse <a>Text</a> into a <a>SubmitRes</a>.
